# Conway's Game of Life

## The Rules
For a space that is 'populated':
```bash
Each cell with one or no neighbours dies, as if by solitude.
Each cell with four or more neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Each cell with two or three neighbours survives.
```
For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
```bash
Each cell with three neighbours becomes populated.
```
